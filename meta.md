# Pros and Cons

Pros and cons we notice about using github (or any version control software) for (potentially) collaborative writing.

### Pros

- The very existence of facilities for branching, integrating, (sorry, I only know Perforce terms) and reorganizing, softly nudges me toward a habit of: braindump first, rework later. It feels very safe to operate in this manner in a version control system.

- I find myself never worrying about "credit." Even though it's a public repository, there's always proof of who wrote what and when. More importantly, I think when writing collaboratively, it would eliminate any fear of anyone misremembering who wrote what. Kind of a paranoid point here, but, some of us have real anxieties like this. Not because we're out to steal others' work, but because we're afraid to take credit (or too much credit) accidentally or unknowingly.

### Cons
