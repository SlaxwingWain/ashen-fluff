In his growing indignation, he forgot that he would have undeniably accepted Heather's [another woman's] next invitation, whenever that was to be.

"It's because of this that I'll go out with Heather," his memory penned; and history looked on without a word, then shamefully turned its face.

What happens next? Julie (the first woman) does have dinner with the other man.

Brainstorm:

- Which one of them should die? What would each of their regrets look like? In whom or what would each of them find haven?
  - Julie is kind of the less analytical partner (since I modeled all this based on my relationships). If she died, wouldn't it be too easy of a resolution for Miles? Like, "Oh well, she died, and it was out of my control, here's Heather." Whereas if Max died, Julie, the less analytical, nonetheless lives on, and the readers feel that they know a lot of things that Julie didn't know, and Max unjustly never got to say... It would be interesting to develop Max as the main character, Julie as a supporting object (as in, objective, of Max and other men; like a rivalry centered around her; tension fueled by desire for her), but then kill him off, and develop Julie as a wholly new person: in Part 1, ignorant; in Part 2, more complex; in Part 3: the hidden realms of Bonny and Elle I was never able to access, but that make them better people than I ever was.
- How can I do something Beerbohm-esque without resorting to the same thing, _e.g._ ghosts and gods?
  - Wait, why not copy Beerbohm exactly? One of my favorite stories in TBK was of Elder Zosima's youth, and Dostoevsky unabashedly copied the story from a parable or something he found in a text in a monastery. How many in our modern world has read Beerbohm? I don't imagine many. If I think it's such a brilliant device, why don't I copy it as closely as I can, so that it's clear who I'm referencing? I don't want to be plagiarist; I would want to be as clearly as possible, a reinventor; and those familiar with Beerbohm would see homage and cheer.
  - But actually, are't I thinking more of a ghost from "CivilWarLand in Bad Decline" (the shortstory itself, not the collection)?
- Can we use a global adventure to make the story sound much bigger in scope to readers? I want readers to feel like they went on an odyssey, the way TBK did for me. But wait, TBK barely left Petersburg. TBK just had so, so many characters with diverse motivations. Would geographic diversity just fragment the story?
