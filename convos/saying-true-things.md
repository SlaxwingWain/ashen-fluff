In his growing indignation, he forgot that he would have undeniably accepted Heather's [another woman's] next invitation, whenever that was to be. Hundreds of causal arrows in his brain quivered like [magnetic] compasses, then turned about face. "It's because of this that I'll go out with Heather," his memory penned; and history looked on without a word, then shamefully turned its face.

What happens next? Julie (the first woman) does have dinner with the other man.

Brainstorm:

- Which one of them should die? What would each of their regrets look like? In whom or what would each of them find haven?
  - Julie is kind of the less analytical partner (since I modeled all this based on my relationships). If she died, wouldn't it be too easy of a resolution for Miles? Like, "Oh well, she died, and it was out of my control, here's Heather." Whereas if Max died, Julie, the less analytical, nonetheless lives on, and the readers feel that they know a lot of things that Julie didn't know, and Max unjustly never got to say... but I feel like I am simply making it a fantasy story about my own wishes, somehow.
- How can I do something Beerbohm-esque without resorting to the same thing, _e.g._ ghosts and gods?
- Can we use a global adventure to make the story sound much bigger in scope to readers? I want readers to feel like they went on an odyssey, the way TBK did for me. But wait, TBK barely left Petersburg. TBK just had so, so many characters with diverse motivations. Would geographic diversity just fragment the story?
