### (Untitled)

In an otherwise peaceful suburb, lately there has been a series of murders, sometimes of groups, whose killer has not yet to be identified. One night, a bomb detonates at a dance hall (music venue), killing several, injuring tens. A young man in his early 20s learns of this the next morning. He had visited this venue several months ago, and been insulted by a bouncer. He still ruminates on the night, wishing he had said this, or that. This man is, however, also troubled. His inner thoughts will show signs of paranoid psychosis, alternating with fantasies of grandeur. He finds himself fantasizing that he was the bomber, leaving a suicide note saying the bouncer was to blame. But quickly he feels the fantasy is weak, unworthy of pursuing any further. (The important thing is to highlight the uselessness of his thoughts, and his own realization of it, whereas usually such characters are presented strongly.)

Some bad things happen to him, pushing him to his limits.

He takes credit for the bombing under an alias, in just as clever a way that he doesn't get caught either. He blames the bouncer successfully. Police begin to gather all names of visitors at the music venue, and interrogating the bouncer for people who have been in altercations with him.

But the young man begins to make up convincing stories as to how he killed other victims and got away with it, and why. He mixes subtle hints that he belives will misdirect the police.

Now, as all this happen, the young man begins to feel more and more liberated from his previous woes. He has given up on a future, living completely in the present, ever just a step away from being locked up indefinitely. During this transformation he begins to feel familiar emotions from the past: happier times.
